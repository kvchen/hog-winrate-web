hog-winrate-web
===============

## Overview

This webapp is a platform for students in CS61A to see how their Hog strategies perform in real time. It uses a modified version of [Codeframe](https://github.com/kvchen/codeframe) on the backend to run code in virtualized containers.

It's also written in the most hipster frameworks I could find.
